## Data
Download the extract the data.

```bash
for i in `seq -w 1 56`; do wget http://humanflow.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/HumanFlowDataset.7z.0$i -c; done ;
7z x HumanFlowDataset.7z.001
```
Alternately, you can download from the [webpage](http://humanflow.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/).

**NOTE:** The directions of flow fields in `.flo` files are reversed from the original convention. So, it is required to either change the sign of flow fields either while training, or while prediction if you would like to stick to original convention of [Middlebury](http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/). We train the network using original data and change the sign while prediction. If this is not clear, please raise a Github issue or write me an email.

## Trained Models
The pretrained models are available in `pretrained/` directory. There are two models:
1. `human_flow_model.t7` is the original trained model as evaluated in the paper.
2. `human_flow_model_noise_adaptive.t7` is trained with additional noisy data.

## Setup
You need to have [Torch.](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_)

Install other required packages
```bash
cd extras/spybhwd
luarocks make
cd ../stnbhwd
luarocks make
```

## Usage
#### Load the model
```lua
stn = require 'stn'
bodynet = require 'bodynet'
easyComputeFlow = bodynet.easy_setup('pretrained/human_flow_model_[noise_adaptive].t7')
```
#### Load images and compute flow
```lua
im1 = image.load(<IMAGE_PATH_1>, 3, 'float')
im2 = image.load(<IMAGE_PATH_2>, 3, 'float')
flow = easyComputeFlow(im1, im2)
```
To save or visualize optical flow, refer to `flowExtensions.lua`

## Training
```bash
th main.lua -netType fullBodyModel -nGPU 4 -nDonkeys 16 -LR 1e-6 -epochSize 1000 -data <PATH_TO_DATASET>
```
