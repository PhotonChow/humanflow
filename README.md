## Data
We are working releasing the training data soon.

<a name="models"></a>
## Data
We are working releasing the trained models soon.

<a name="setUp"></a>
## Setup
You need to have [Torch.](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_)

Install other required packages
```bash
cd extras/spybhwd
luarocks make
cd ../stnbhwd
luarocks make
```
<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage
#### Load the model
```lua
humanflownet = torch.load(<MODEL_PATH>):cuda()
```
#### Load images and compute flow
```lua
im1 = image.load(<IMAGE_PATH_1>)
im2 = image.load(<IMAGE_PATH_2>)
flow = humanflownet:forward(im1, im2)
```
